# Intermediate-Python

This is a 2-3 month course that aims to teach intermediate concepts in Python. Concepts will range from iterators/generators to machine learning and natural language processing. At the end of the course, we will incorporate an open-ended project where at least one of these topics is explored in greater detail.
